Common Causes and Solutions:
1. Azure CLI Not Logged In
Make sure you’re logged into Azure using the CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
az login
Check your active subscription:

bash
Copy
Edit
az account show
If you have multiple subscriptions, set the desired one:

bash
Copy
Edit
az account set --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
2. Missing Environment Variables / Credentials
If you are running this in a non-interactive environment (like CI/CD), you may need a Service Principal:

Create a Service Principal:
bash
Copy
Edit
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "cdktf-backend" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
This will output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "appId": "xxxxxxx",
  "displayName": "cdktf-backend",
  "password": "xxxxxxx",
  "tenant": "xxxxxxx"
}
Set the following environment variables:
bash
Copy
Edit
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<appId>
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<password>
export ARM_TENANT_ID=<tenant>
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
CDKTF and Terraform will automatically pick these up.

3. Check the Backend Configuration
Ensure your backend block is correct, especially the storage account name, container, and key fields. If these are wrong, Azure will reject the request.

Example override:

typescript
Copy
Edit
this.addOverride("terraform.backend", {
  azurerm: {
    resource_group_name: "my-resource-group",
    storage_account_name: "mystorageaccount",
    container_name: "mycontainer",
    key: "terraform.tfstate",
  },
});
Ensure the storage account and container already exist if you're not provisioning them in your CDKTF code.

4. Provider Configuration
Ensure the AzureRM provider block is properly configured:

typescript
Copy
Edit
new AzurermProvider(this, "AzureRm", {
  features: {},
});
This is usually sufficient if you’re using the environment variables or Azure CLI auth.

Final Test
Once you’ve set up the environment variables or logged in via az login, try running:

bash
Copy
Edit
cdktf deploy
If you still hit the error, what's the exact error message and stack trace you're getting? That can help pinpoint the issue.
